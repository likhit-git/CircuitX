# Secure Lock Using VSDSquadron Mini
## Introduction
Due to the advancement of science and technology worldwide, there may be a consequent growth in the fee and sophistication of crime. As a result, it is essential to ensure the safety of oneself and one’s treasured belongings; despite mechanical locks, the crime price has multiplied since those locks are effortlessly damaged. Consequently, traditional locking systems that use a mechanical lock and key are nowadays replaced with new, advanced locking systems. With the advancement of the digital age, these systems are being replaced by digital systems that rely on inputs like pins, fingerprints, image processing, or a combination of these. 

## Overview
This project integrates mechanical and electronic devices and is highly programable and compatible. One of the prominent features of these innovative locks is their simplicity and high efficiency. This work is of an electronic combination lock with a keyboard mounted on the door for keying in the secret code. This automatic lock system consists of an electronic control assembly, which controls the output load through a password. This output load here is a Stepper motor that controls the door (for reducing the BOM, we are using an LED instead of the motor here). LCD is attached to the lock system, which displays the lock's current status. The coding unit, which operates with a 12-switch (matrix) keypad, was designed to control an electromechanical door lock with five–digit code. When the keypad is fed a correct password, the door will open for 10 seconds and then close it. 
Additional features that can be added to implement it beyond this project:
A separate counter can be added to tell how many people have entered the room. Unlike other locks, this lock can be constructed so that once the wrong keys are pressed, it resets automatically, making it harder for an intruder to break in. It tells about the number of attempts the person makes before making an alarm. It can be programmed to blow an alarm after three error count entries. This password-based "Secure Lock Using VSDSquadron Mini" can thus be used in places where we need more security.
